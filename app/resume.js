Having never met or worked with Connor before, all I can say is nothing but the highest regards for this individual. His commitment to our team, dedication to drive to a solution (even coding into the wee hours of day 2), and his professional attitude in working with team mates with whom he had never work with before. ... I highly recommend Connor and, as a matter of fact, would not hesitate to bring him onto any of my teams. I truly believe in 'deeds and not words'. Connor has proven himself through his amazing 'deeds' for the team and our solution which evidently placed us in the Top 3 for the event! Thank-you Connor!!! "
